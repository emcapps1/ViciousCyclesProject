  <br><p>These are the main things we do, services we provide, and things you'll want to know about us:</p><br>
  <ul>
  <li>1. We do custom builds! Our staff will assist you every step of the way and work closely with you to get make your vision for customizations come to life. All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</li>
  <li>2. We do repairs! If you want something modified or need something fixed, just come on down and we'll help you out. Riding is a lifestyle and lifestyles have their highs and lows, and we'll make sure that those lows are fixed and don't cramp your style.</li>
  <li>3. We exhibit at several trade shows every year. We love showing off our products and services to potential customers.</li>
