    Vicious Cycles Inc is a Raleigh-based cycle workshop that was founded in late 2010. A bunch of like-minded individuals kept seeing advertisements for several different bike shops and started talking hypothetically about what they would do and what type of service they would provide if they were in charge of their own cycle shop. 
    Eventually, they came together and decided to make that dream a reality.</p><br>

    <p>The origin of how Vicious Cycles came to be is the quintessential "started from the bottom" tale and an example of how it often only takes a simple idea to get the ball rolling on the journey to success. A passion for cycling, always finding new ways to keep up with the competition, and an interest in giving customers the best service possible are the main things that have kept our company successful and well-liked for so many years. Why not come on down so you can see for yourself what the hype is all about?</p>
